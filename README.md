🚀 Your First AI Agent: From Prompt to Action


This notebook is your first step into building AI agents. An agent can do more than just respond to a prompt — it can take actions to find information or get things done.

In this notebook, you'll:

✅ Install Agent Development Kit (ADK)
✅ Configure your API key to use the Gemini model
✅ Build your first simple agent
✅ Run your agent and watch it use a tool (like Google Search) to answer a question
